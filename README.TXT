this project is using EJS, please search for it in internet and take a look over it. ( we know that you probably dont know the EJS, we want to see how you would deal with it.)
There are several things I would like you to do

1: impliment the remember me functionality. It should be implimented in the controller.js file under the folder controllers
2: Allow login using email. This should be implimented in the user.js under the models folder
3: Search for a user with the username that was provided OR the email that was provided in controllers.js
4: Add ejs in login.ejs and signup.ejs to show the errorMessage provided by controller.js
5: edit the UI of signup.ejs to match the UI in "Finished Signup.ejs.png" under the Example Finished
6: Please create a page called configureCreatorAfterSignup.ejs (or whatever you would like), this ejs file will allow the user to select a photo (a profile photo) from their file system, this ejs file will be presented to the user right after they sign up. Upload the file to the backend. Check to make sure that in fact the file is an image (on the front end I know you can limit the types of files that can be uploaded but please also provide a backend check). Convert / Crop the photo to a 300 x 300 pixel image no matter what aspect ratio or photo size is uploaded, You may use any npm module you can find. Save this profile photo to the backend file system. Attribute this file to the user and make it so that the image is presented on the homepage.
